OpenCV-AR
=========

This is a simple OpenCV based augmented reality application. After you run the code, it 
will open up the webcam. Just hold the chessboard pattern against the webcam (you can 
either take a printout or hold it up using your phone). If everything goes well, you 
should be able to see the tiger image replacing the chessboard pattern in the live video 
stream. You can move the chessboard, rotate it, change its perspective etc. It will be 
tracked accordingly and the corresponding movements will be reflected in the video stream 
with the tiger image.
